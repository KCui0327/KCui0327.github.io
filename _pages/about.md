I am currently a **senior at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)**, pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering** ([ECE](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/)).

Previously, I have interned at **[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)**, **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)**, and **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html)** as a **SWE** where I worked on...

- `System Software`
- `Distributed Systems`

My passion lies in **distributed systems** and **ML infrastructure**! I am particularly focused on building **data and compute platforms** to make AI/ML accessible and enable others to create real-world impact.
